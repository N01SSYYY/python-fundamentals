Difference between for and while:
A for loop is used when the number of iterations is known or when looping over a sequence.
A while loop is used when repetition depends on a condition and the number of iterations is not known in advance.

Why infinite loops happen:
Infinite loops happen when the loop condition never becomes false, usually because the loop variable is not updated or there is no exit condition.

Difference between break and continue:
break immediately exits the loop.
continue skips the current iteration and moves to the next one.

One real use-case for each loop:
A for loop is used to iterate over a fixed range or collection of values.
A while loop is used when repetition depends on user input or a changing condition.
